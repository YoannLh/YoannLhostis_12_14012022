# How to install and run

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You need the last LTS version of Node.js installed on your machine.

## Back

Fork the API here : https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard

'npm install' in main directory to install dependencies

You have to change the port 3000 at line 8 of index.js with 3001

const port = 3000   >>>   const port = 3001

Then npm start

## Front

Fork this repo

'npm install' in main directory to install dependencies

Then npm start

There are actually no home page and real effective routing, so you'll be redirected on 'http://localhost:3000' with a customised error message (it's normal).

The API has only 2 users for the moment (id 12 and 18) you can see them at 'http://localhost:3000/user?id=12' and 'http://localhost:3000/user?id=18'
